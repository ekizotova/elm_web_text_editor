# WEB text editor in _ELM_ 

## Primary goal of the application is to create simple web text editor completely in ELM

Usefull functions can be: 
- simple text formating (bold, italic, etc.)
- layout formating (lean towards left/right/center or make header)
- add tab
- transform "-" into em-dash when needed
- download of formated text as a file 

Additional functions to think about:
- correction of spaces between words or around punctuation (something like pretty-print button)

### Main idea: to control and edit text highlighted with cursor (cursor-controlled settings)  

back-up plan: think about setting flags around the text and pretty-print at the other area
